# Chatbot Prototype Development

## Ready to Develop
In BCG's tech hub, your notable achievements in data extraction and analysis have paved the way for a new challenge. Aisha has outlined the next phase of the project: the creation of an AI chatbot that transforms complex financial data into actionable insights. This tool will revolutionize how GFC navigates financial decisions by making intricate data accessible and understandable.

As you embark on this endeavor, it's important to recognize that you're part of a broader, dynamic team, each with specialized roles that contribute to the chatbot's development. Your primary focus will be on implementing rule-based logic, a foundational aspect that ensures the chatbot can respond accurately to a set of predefined financial queries. This task is essential for giving the chatbot its initial "understanding" of user inquiries and its ability to provide immediate, reliable information.

Meanwhile, other team members will tackle different facets of the chatbot's development:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Experts:** Colleagues specializing in NLP are refining the chatbot's ability to parse and understand the nuances of human language, enabling it to interact more naturally with users.
- **Machine Learning Engineers:** This segment of the team is dedicated to incorporating machine learning algorithms that allow the chatbot to learn from interactions, improve its responses over time, and handle more complex queries beyond the rule-based scope.
- **Data Integration Specialists:** These team members focus on the seamless integration of financial data, ensuring the chatbot has real-time access to accurate and comprehensive financial information.
- **User Experience (UX) Designers:** UX designers ensure that interactions with the chatbot are intuitive and user-friendly, designing interfaces that make financial insights accessible to all users, regardless of their financial expertise.

Your role in developing the rule-based logic is a critical piece of a much larger puzzle. By focusing on this aspect, you're laying the groundwork for the chatbot's functionality and enabling further developments in AI, machine learning, and user interaction. As you progress, remember that collaboration and communication with your team are key. Your work on rule-based logic sets the stage for the more sophisticated functionalities that your teammates are building, moving us closer to revolutionizing financial analysis for GFC.

## Chatbot Prototype
Building a fully functional AI chatbot for financial analysis is a complex process involving advanced programming and deep learning techniques. However, to fit our learning objectives and time constraints, we've tailored a simplified task. This streamlined version will introduce you to the basics of chatbot development, focusing on creating a prototype that responds to predefined financial queries. It's a first step into the world of AI chatbots, offering a glimpse into their potential without the need for extensive development time or advanced technical skills. Let's begin this journey, keeping an eye on the bigger picture while we tackle this accessible task.

### Step 1: Preparation
- **Review the analyzed data:** Quickly review the financial data you analyzed in Task 1 to refresh your memory on what information is available.
- **Set up your environment:** Ensure Python and essential libraries (like pandas for data handling and Flask for a simple web application, if applicable) are installed.

### Step 2: Chatbot Design and Data Preparation
- **Define predefined queries:** Select 3 to 5 common financial queries (e.g., "What is the total revenue?", "How has net income changed over the last year?").
- **Prepare responses:** Use the analyzed financial data to create canned responses for these queries. This step involves mapping each predefined query to a specific response based on your data analysis.

### Step 3: Basic Chatbot Development
- **Chatbot logic:** Write a simple Python script that uses if-else statements to match user input (the predefined queries) to the responses you prepared. For a more interactive experience, consider using a basic Python library such as `input()` for command-line interaction or a simple Flask app for web-based interaction.

#### Example Python Script:
```python
def simple_chatbot(user_query):
    if user_query == "What is the total revenue?":
        return "The total revenue is [amount]."
    elif user_query == "How has net income changed over the last year?":
        return "The net income has [increased/decreased] by [amount] over the last year."
    # Add more conditions for other predefined queries
    else:
        return "Sorry, I can only provide information on predefined queries."
```

### Step 4: Demonstration and Documentation
- **Test your chatbot:** Spend a few minutes testing the chatbot with the predefined queries to ensure it responds correctly.
- **Prepare brief documentation:** Write a short summary explaining how your chatbot works, the predefined queries it can respond to, and any limitations.
